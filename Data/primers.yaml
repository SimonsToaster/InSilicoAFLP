# PRIMERS
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This file contains information about primers, their name, their core 
# sequence, the selective bases, and the associated restriction enzyme.
# primer_name: must be unique in the file.
# enzyme_name: Enzyme used in the digest
# core_sequence: the 5' to 3' sequence in upper case letters, only A, T,
# G, C are allowed. The core sequence is the sequence complementary to the 
# ligated adapter and  (partially) complementary to the recognition sequence 
# of the restriction enzyme used in the digest. The selective bases ARE NOT 
# part of the core sequence.
# selective bases: the 5' to 3' sequence of the selective bases used to 
# select a subset of fragments for amplification. Needs to be uppercase 
# letters and at least one base long. More than three bases are discuraged
# as loss of specificity occurs. 
# IUPAC code for nuclotide sequences is supported:
#
#       A, C, T, G      normal bases
#       R               A or G
#       Y               C or T
#       S               C or G
#       W               A or T
#       K               G or T
#       M               A or C
#       B               C or G or T
#       D               A or G or T
#       H               A or C or T
#       V               A or C or G
#       N               A or C or G or T
#
# During execution the program will generate unique primers from degenerated 
# ones and create fingerprints for each. 
#
#Consider the following illustrative example for a primer for an EcoRI (G/AATTC) 
# digest:
#
#       5'-GACTGCGTACC|AATTC|ATY-3'
#
# The first 11 bases are complementary to the adapet used, the sequence thus
# depends on the used adapter used. The next five bases are complementary
# to the recognition seqeunce of the restriction enzyme used. The next three
# bases are the selective bases and are not part of the core structure.
# The cores structure would be: GACTGCGTACCAATTC
# The selective bases would be: ATY
# The program would create primers with the selective bases ATC and ATT and
# generate fingerprints for each.
