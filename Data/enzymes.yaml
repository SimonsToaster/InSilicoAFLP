# RESTRICTION ENZYMES
#--------------------------------------------------------------

# This file contains information about restriction enzymes, 
# their name and their recognition sequence. 
# NAME: must be unique in the file.
# RECOGNITION_SEQUENCE: the 5' to 3' recognition sequence in 
# upper case letters with the cut site indicated by a slash (/).
# The cut site needs to be inside the recognition sequence, only
# unambigious sequences (consisting of A, T, C, G) are allowed.

# The enzymes here sorted according to the length of the recognition 
# sequence and alphabetically by their name. The data was taken from
# the NEB catalogue. It is therfore NOT KNOWN whether they perform
# adequately in real life experiments.
