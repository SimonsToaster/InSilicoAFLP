Test space:



EXPLANATIONS:
mode: 		"optimize": looks for the n best combinations of restriction enzymes and selective bases creating the fingerprint with the least amount of overlapping bands
		"test": creates a fingerprint from the given entries in the search space
best:		the n best results of optimization for the report
method:		how many enyzmes are used in the digest
		"single"
		"double"
		"triple"
upper_limit:	Upper limit for electrophoresis resolution, longer fragments are discarded
lower_limit:	Lower limit for the electrophoresis resolution, smaller fragments are discarded
resolution:	Size difference between fragments in percent which do not overlap
Ladder:		Fragments size of fragments in the electrophoresis ladder
Space:		Information on restriction enzymes and the associated primers
		NameRE:			just the name of the restriction enyzme for the report
		recognition_site	Recognition site of the restriction enzyme with the cut site indicated by a / or ^. Only ACGT is accepted
		adaptor_name		Adaptor name for the report
		adaptor_seqeunence	Required to make fragments of correct length and seqeunce, only ACGTN are accepted.
		primer_name		Primer name for report
		primer_core		Primer core sequence, adaptor+recognition site enzyme. Only ACGTN are accepted
		selective_bases		A 1 to 3 nuclotide long specification of the selective bases, follows IUPAC nomenclature. If mode is test only ACTG are accepted. 

In mode "optimization" the script constructs a search queue with all possible combinations of restriction enzyme and primers for the report. Be carefull not to overlaod it.

Test sapce:	lines from the space to be combined to create combinations for which fingerprints are to be generated.
